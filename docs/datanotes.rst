Some notes on the data
======================

Electron affinity
-----------------

Electron affinites we taken from [2]_ for the elements for which the data was
available. For He, Be, N, Ar and Xe afinities were taken from [3]_ where they
were specified for metastable ions and therefore the values are negative.
